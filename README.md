# ReinforcementLearningBasic 

This repository is created just for learning the RL.
The recommended resources are listed as below:

1.  The MOOC :  Reinforcement learning from Udacity .  https://cn.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600
2.  The book:    Reinforcement learning: an introduction 2nd Edition.   http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html
     It is highly recommended to run the source code programmed for this book and take your own experiments.  
3.  The lecture given by David Silver: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Silver/web/Teaching.html  David silver now seems working in 
    DeepMind team. 
     
 
# The programming language
 The programming lauguage is not decided yet but Python will be the first option.  Today, Python is supported by most of the machine learning  frameworks and becomes a de facto standard programming language in this domain. There are lots of python code bases and ML libraries  that could be leveraged.  
 
 Updated: Finally, python is taken as the primary language. 
 
# The materials

Contraction mapping is one of the most important theorems applied in RL. Bellman equation is built on it.   

# The work folder
 where the source codes live
