## Concepts  

> ####  On policy &  Off Policy
> For evaluation, it is obvious that there will be two different policis , one behavior policy  and  one ta         rget policy.  This is so called off policy.  


> But for control, the keypoint is to check the  update rule whether depending on the same policy.  For example, the expected SARSA is on policy algorithm in that the Q value is updated by using the behavior policy to average  the next state's q values.
